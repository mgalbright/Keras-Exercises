# Keras-Exercises
Short deep learning projects with Keras

In *1_InterpretingFeatures*, I illustrate an interesting
connection between neural nets and template matching (a computer
vision technique for comparing images).  Specifically,
I show how we can interpret the weight vectors in 
single-layer neural nets as templates for template matching.
This can help us understand how simple neural nets work.  In the 
second half of the notebook, I discuss an alternate interpretation of
weights in convolutional neural nets as low-level filters for feature generation.
